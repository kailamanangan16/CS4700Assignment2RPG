Here is the link to the tutorial series that I followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5sMq8PrWuM&list=PL4vbr3u7UKWp0iM1WIfRjCDTI03u43Zfu

## Key Features
* Custom Main Character: movement, interaction with key items, collision with items throughout the town, etc.
* Items to be collected: Bacon, Beer, and Apple Pie.
* Enemies: two ghosts lurk around the town that will follow and attack the player.
* Inventory System. Items that are gathered by the player are used to complete the game once they are brought to the creature.

## Custom Scenario
The traveller must collect items to befriend a strange creature that has entered their town. 

## Challenges Faced + Solutions
* This was my first time creating a sprite sheet, and the quality when imported ressembled a zombie. Fortunately, by changing the bit quality, I fixed the issue.
* I had a red ghost that would originally not function correctly. I unfortunately had to scrap that ghost, but I managed to replace it with two more effective ghosts.
* The game over screen was difficult in the beginning, as it would not appear. Fortunately, it came down to a couple smaller errors that I overlooked.
